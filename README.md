# Brain Tumor Detection

## Overview
This project is a **Brain Tumor Detection System** using an **MLP deep learning model**. The model classifies brain MRI images into four categories:
- **Glioma**
- **Meningioma**
- **No Tumor**
- **Pituitary**

The application is built using **Streamlit** and **TensorFlow**, providing an easy-to-use interface for uploading MRI scans and getting real-time predictions.

## 🛠️ Installation
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/KartikNimhan/Brain-Tumor-Detection.git
cd Brain-Tumor-Detection
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Download the Pre-trained Model
Since the model file (`mlp_model.h5`) is too large for GitHub, you can download it from Google Drive:

📥 **[Download Model (Google Drive)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DNTO5SAyxty_4EkUt9DWzlOKaHs2YG08/view?usp=sharing)**

After downloading, place `mlp_model.h5` inside the project folder.

---
## 🔥 Usage
Run the Streamlit application:
```sh
streamlit run app.py
```
Upload an MRI scan and get a prediction on tumor type.

---
## 🧠 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow/Keras**
- **Streamlit**
- **NumPy & PIL**
- **Google Drive (for model storage)**
